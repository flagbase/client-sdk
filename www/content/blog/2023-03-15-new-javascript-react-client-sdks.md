We are thrilled to announce the release of Flagbase's new client SDKs for React and JavaScript. These SDKs have been designed to help you efficiently manage feature flags and experiments in your web applications, enabling you to roll out new features and improvements with ease.

The Flagbase JavaScript Client-side SDK is a lightweight library offering several key features, including efficient and fast feature flag evaluations, client-side API for accessing and manipulating flags, traits, and identifiers, event-driven architecture with support for custom event listeners, and an extensible, easy-to-use API for flag management.

On the other hand, the React Client SDK is the official React client-side SDK for Flagbase, specifically tailored for React applications. It provides easy integration with React components and hooks, allowing developers to manage and use feature flags seamlessly within their React applications.

## How to Get Started
To begin using the Flagbase SDKs in your projects, you can install them via npm or yarn.

For the JavaScript SDK, run the following command:
```bash
npm install @flagbase/js-client-sdk
```
or with yarn:
```bash
yarn add @flagbase/js-client-sdk
```

For the React SDK, use the following commands:
```bash
npm install @flagbase/react-client-sdk
```

```bash
yarn add @flagbase/react-client-sdk
```

Once installed, you can import the SDKs into your application and start using them to manage feature flags and experiments. The SDKs come with comprehensive documentation and API references, making it easy for developers to understand and use the various methods and functionalities provided by the SDKs.

# What's Next?
We are dedicated to continually improving and expanding the capabilities of our SDKs. We welcome your feedback, bug reports, feature requests, and contributions to help make our SDKs even better. If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.

In the future, we plan to add more features and enhancements to our SDKs, as well as support for additional platforms and frameworks. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from the Flagbase team!
