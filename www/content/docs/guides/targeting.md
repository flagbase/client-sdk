# Targeting

Targeting users in the context of feature flags is the process of selectively enabling or disabling features for specific users or user groups based on predefined criteria. This allows developers and product managers to roll out new features gradually, test features on specific user segments, or personalize the user experience.

To implement user targeting, you can use the following strategies:
* Attributes-based targeting: Define criteria based on user attributes such as location, device type, user role, or any other custom attributes. Feature flags can be toggled on or off for users who meet the defined criteria.
1. Percentage-based targeting: Gradually roll out features to a percentage of users by defining a random split. This allows you to test the impact of new features on a small user group before rolling them out to a larger audience.
1. Cohort-based targeting: Target specific user groups or cohorts based on their behavior, preferences, or other characteristics. This allows for more precise personalization and can help you test features on specific user segments.
1. Whitelisting or blacklisting: Explicitly enable or disable features for specific users or user groups by adding them to a whitelist or a blacklist. Whitelisting allows you to enable features for a select group of users, while blacklisting prevents certain users from accessing specific features.

To effectively target users with feature flags, you'll need a feature flag management system that supports user targeting capabilities. You can use third-party solutions or build your own system, depending on your requirements. Once implemented, targeting users with feature flags allows you to experiment, iterate, and optimize your product's user experience with minimal risk.
