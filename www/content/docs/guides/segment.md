# Segment

Segments, in the context of feature flags and user targeting, are groups of users that share common characteristics, behaviors, or attributes. By creating segments, you can selectively enable or disable features for specific user groups, allowing for more personalized experiences, gradual feature rollouts, and testing of new features on specific user populations.

Segments can be created based on various criteria, such as:

1. Demographics: Group users based on attributes like age, gender, location, or language.
1. Behavioral patterns: Segment users according to their actions or usage patterns within your application, such as frequent or infrequent users, power users, or users who have completed specific in-app events.
1. User attributes: Create segments based on custom user attributes, such as user roles (e.g., admin, regular user, guest), subscription tiers, or any other custom-defined properties.
1. Technology: Group users based on the device, browser, or operating system they are using.

Segmentation allows you to fine-tune your feature flag strategy and gain better insights into how different user groups respond to new features or changes. By targeting specific segments, you can minimize the risk associated with rolling out new features, optimize your product for different user groups, and make data-driven decisions to improve your overall user experience.
