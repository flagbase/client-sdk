# Project

A project is a structured way to organize and manage feature flags and user segments within Flagbase. It serves as a container for flags and segments, allowing you to efficiently manage and track different features and user groups associated with your application. Each project can have multiple environments, enabling you to test and deploy features in various stages of your development lifecycle, such as development, staging, and production.

In summary, a project:

- Represents a collection of feature flags and user segments.
- Serves as an organizational unit for managing flags and segments within an application.
- Can contain multiple environments for testing and deploying features across different stages of the development lifecycle.
